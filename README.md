# Pygame-Wifi-Scanner
Python/Pygame based wifi scanner for MacOS. CLI only, (subprocess) minimal libraries needed.

For this to work, you need to put in your Mac login password.
Either change the "userpassword=''" line, or create a file called psw.txt and change the f=open redirect to point to that file.
